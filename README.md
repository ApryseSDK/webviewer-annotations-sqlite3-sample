# WebViewer annotations sample - using SQLite3 and Node.js backend

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/web/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse SDK](https://apryse.com/). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into web projects.
